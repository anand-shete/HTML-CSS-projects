    <!-- How Search Engines Work?
    Crawling:
        Search engines use bots (spiders) to scan the web, following links to discover pages.
        Tools like a robots.txt file can guide crawlers on what to index.
    Indexing:
        After crawling, search engines store and organize content in their database (index).
        The indexed content is what appears in search results.
    Ranking:
        Search engines rank pages based on relevance, quality, and authority for a given query.
