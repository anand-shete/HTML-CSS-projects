/*
Media queries in CSS are used to apply different styles to a web page based on the characteristics of the device or viewport, such as its width, height, orientation, and resolution. They enable responsive design, allowing a single set of HTML markup to adapt to various devices and screen sizes. 

@media media-type and (media-feature) {  
    // CSS rules to apply when the media query conditions are met  
}
Media Type: Specifies the type of device or display, such as screen, print, speech, etc. This part is optional but often used.
Media Feature: Specifies the condition or characteristic being checked, such as width, height, orientation, etc.
CSS Rules: Styles within the curly braces {} apply only when the conditions specified in the media query are true.
