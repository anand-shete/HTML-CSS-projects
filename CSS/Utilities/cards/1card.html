            <h3> Northern Lights</h3>
            <p class="text">
                The northern lights, also known as the aurora borealis, are a natural light display in the
                Earth's sky. They are caused by solar activity that releases charged particles into space. Some of these
                particles reach Earth and collide with atoms in the atmosphere, creating the northern lights.
